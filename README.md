# Local Weather App

**About the Project**

The Show Local Weather App is of of the intermediate challenges found on FreeCodeCamp.com.

**Features**

* Generated weather data based on latitude and longitude coordinates.
* API's used include Open Weather API, and ipinfo.io.
* Different Icons and Background images depending on local weather.
* Functions for converting kelvins into fahrenheit and celsius on click.
* Object Oriented JS

**What I learned**

For this project I learned how to use the two API's mentioned above.  Initially I used the HTML5 geolocation spec, however soon found that it had been removed from chrome on unsecured http requests.  Therefore I researched other options and was able to find that I could aslo obtain the needed coords with the user's IP address.
